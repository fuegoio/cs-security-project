# Singularity of Origin

This framework has been developed by the NCC Group and available here : [https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity).

We use it as a server to power our DNS Rebinding attack. We updated the `html` folder with our fake front-end (`hangman`) compiled, and improve the configuration and source code for our use case.
