# Passwords server

This is the simple server that we use to simulate a HTTP Password manager that can be exploited by our DNS Rebinding attack.

In our demo, this simple python server is hosted on a different machine that the one that is under attack. This server is located under the `10.0.0.3` ip address, and is available on the port `5000`.
